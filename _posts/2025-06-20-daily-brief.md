**Sarah (TTS Voice: Australian Female, Warm)**: G’day, Aussies! Welcome to *The Pub Test* Daily Brief, bringing you the facts from the last 24 hours. I’m Sarah, your virtual host.

**Tom (TTS Voice: Australian Male, Friendly)**: And I’m Tom. Today, we’ve got the latest on geopolitics, global economics, and local Australian news. Straight to the point—let’s dive in.

## Geopolitics: Middle East Tensions

**Sarah**: Israel intensified strikes on Iran, targeting nuclear and energy sites, including a heavy-water reactor in Arak. Iranian state media reported no radiation danger. Iran fired missiles at Israel, with 24 injuries in Judean Foothills.

**Tom**: Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, vowed not to surrender, threatening “irreparable damage” if the U.S. joins Israel. U.S. President Donald Trump approved attack plans but hasn’t given final approval, awaiting Iran’s nuclear program response.

**Sarah**: In Gaza, 69 people were killed in the last 24 hours, per the Gaza Health Ministry. Palestinians report the Iran-Israel conflict is diverting attention from their humanitarian crisis.

**Tom**: Iran arrested 24 people for spying for Israel, and Iraq’s Kataeb Hezbollah warned the U.S. against intervening. China’s Xi Jinping called for a ceasefire, urging diplomacy.

## Global Economics: Oil and Markets

**Sarah**: Oil prices rose nearly 3% yesterday, with Brent crude at $74.50 per barrel, up $10 from last month, due to Israel-Iran conflict escalation. Analysts warn a Strait of Hormuz blockade could push prices above $100, impacting global inflation.

**Tom**: The ASX dropped today, reflecting volatile oil prices and fears of U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Nigel Green of deVere Group warned of a market selloff if the U.S. strikes Iran, citing risks to oil and investor confidence.

**Sarah**: In Australia, petrol prices could hit $2.20 per litre if oil exceeds $100 per barrel. Each $1 rise in crude adds 1 cent to pump prices, per analyst Tony Sycamore.

## Local Australian News: Crime and Politics

**Tom**: In Sydney, police arrested three men after a string of armed robberies in the CBD overnight. No injuries reported, but businesses are on alert. More details expected from NSW Police today.

**Sarah**: In Canberra, Treasurer Jim Chalmers addressed the National Press Club, discussing cost-of-living measures. He flagged monitoring Middle East-driven oil price spikes but said they’re unlikely to shift RBA policy yet, per Westpac economists.

**Tom**: Western Australia’s fuel prices remain stable due to 24-hour price lock regulations, with Perth’s lowest prices typically on Tuesdays.
